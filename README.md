# CS231n solutions 

In this repository, you will find my solutions to the assignments given in the course [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) from Stanford University (Spring 2021).

I learned everything from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk). Of course, there are things you cannot find any explanation about some recently invented concepts in the video, but you can learn them by referring to public slides uploaded on this [page](https://cs231n.github.io/).
